00:00:18,023 --> 00:00:20,217
Hello everyone.

3
00:00:20,217 --> 00:00:21,634
I'm Sam,

4
00:00:21,634 --> 00:00:24,401
and I just turned 17.

5
00:00:24,401 --> 00:00:27,648
A few years ago,
before my freshman year in High School,

6
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:32,852
I wanted to play snare drum
in the Foxboro High School Marching Band,

7
00:00:32,852 --> 00:00:35,589
and it was a dream
that I just had to accomplish.

8
00:00:35,589 --> 00:00:37,852
But each snare drum and harness

9
00:00:37,852 --> 00:00:40,155
weighed about 40 pounds each,

10
00:00:40,155 --> 00:00:42,770
and I have a disease called Progeria.

11
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,858
So just to give you an idea,
I weigh only about 50 pounds.

12
00:00:46,858 --> 00:00:51,615
So, logistically, I really couldn't carry
a regular sized snare drum,

13
00:00:51,615 --> 00:00:55,654
and because of this the band director
assigned me to play

14
00:00:55,654 --> 00:00:59,005
pit percussion during the halftime show.

15
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:01,110
Now pit percussion was fun.

16
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,803
It involved some really cool
auxiliary percussion instruments,

17
00:01:04,803 --> 00:01:08,623
like the bongos, timpani,

18
00:01:08,623 --> 00:01:11,107
and timbales, and cowbell.

19
00:01:11,107 --> 00:01:13,318
So it was fun,

20
00:01:13,318 --> 00:01:18,420
but it involved no marching,
and I was just so devastated.

21
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,914
However, nothing was going 
to stop me

22
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,585
from playing snare drum
with the marching band

23
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:25,010
in the halftime show.

24
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:29,865
So my family and I worked
with an engineer to design

25
00:01:29,865 --> 00:01:31,793
a snare drum harness

26
00:01:31,793 --> 00:01:35,580
that would be lighter,
and easier for me to carry.

27
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,638
So after continuous work, we made

28
00:01:39,638 --> 00:01:43,859
a snare drum apparatus
that weighs only about 6 pounds.

29
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:48,129
(Applause)

30
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:52,427
I just want to give you some more
information about Progeria.

31
00:01:52,427 --> 00:01:58,340
It affects only about
350 kids today, worldwide.

32
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,880
So it's pretty rare,

33
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,335
and the effects of Progeria include:

34
00:02:03,335 --> 00:02:07,408
tight skin, lack of weight gain,
stunted growth,

35
00:02:07,408 --> 00:02:09,011
and heart disease.

36
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:12,586
Last year my Mom 
and her team of scientists

37
00:02:12,586 --> 00:02:16,725
published the first successful
Progeria Treatment Study,

38
00:02:16,725 --> 00:02:19,460
and because of this
I was interviewed on NPR,

39
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,006
and John Hamilton asked me
the question:

40
00:02:22,006 --> 00:02:24,272
"What is the most important thing

41
00:02:24,272 --> 00:02:26,538
that people should know about you?"

42
00:02:26,538 --> 00:02:29,264
And my answer was simply that

43
00:02:29,264 --> 00:02:31,691
I have a very happy life.

44
00:02:31,691 --> 00:02:35,762
(Applause)

45
00:02:35,762 --> 00:02:39,663
So even though
there are many obstacles in my life,

46
00:02:39,663 --> 00:02:42,533
with a lot of them
being created by Progeria,

47
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:45,095
I don't want people to feel bad for me.

48
00:02:45,095 --> 00:02:47,802
I don't think about
these obstacles all the time,

49
00:02:47,802 --> 00:02:51,007
and I'm able to overcome
most of them anyway.

50
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:56,132
So I’m here today, to share with you
my philosophy for a happy life.

51
00:02:56,132 --> 00:03:00,757
So, for me,
there are 3 aspects to this philosophy.

52
00:03:00,757 --> 00:03:04,830
So this is a quote
from the famous Ferris Bueller.

53
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,516
The first aspect to my philosophy is that

54
00:03:08,516 --> 00:03:11,552
I’m okay with what I ultimately can’t do

55
00:03:11,552 --> 00:03:14,032
because there is so much I can do.

56
00:03:14,032 --> 00:03:16,799
Now people sometimes 
ask me questions like,

57
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:19,252
"Isn’t it hard living with Progeria?" or

58
00:03:19,252 --> 00:03:22,569
"What daily challenges
of Progeria do you face?"

59
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:26,053
And I’d like to say that,
even though I have Progeria,

60
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:28,686
most of my time
is spent thinking about things

61
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:31,534
that have nothing to do
with Progeria at all.

62
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:36,435
Now this doesn’t mean that I ignore
the negative aspects of these obstacles.

63
00:03:36,435 --> 00:03:38,491
When I can’t do something like

64
00:03:38,491 --> 00:03:42,557
run a long distance,
or go on an intense roller coaster,

65
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:44,583
I know what I’m missing out on.

66
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:48,499
But instead,
I choose to focus on the activities

67
00:03:48,499 --> 00:03:52,276
that I can do through things
that I’m passionate about,

68
00:03:52,276 --> 00:03:55,791
like scouting, or music, or comic books,

69
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:58,756
or any of my favorite Boston sports teams.

70
00:03:58,756 --> 00:04:01,862
Yeah, so --
(Laughter)

71
00:04:01,862 --> 00:04:06,001
However, sometimes I need to find
a different way to do something

72
00:04:06,001 --> 00:04:07,712
by making adjustments,

73
00:04:07,712 --> 00:04:11,799
and I want to put those things
in the "can do" category.

74
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:14,803
Kind of like you saw
with the drum earlier.

75
00:04:14,803 --> 00:04:16,512
So here’s a clip

76
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,951
with me playing Spider-Man

77
00:04:18,951 --> 00:04:21,760
with the Foxboro High School 
Marching Band

78
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,864
at halftime a couple of years ago.

79
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,968
(Video)

80
00:04:26,648 --> 00:04:32,026
♫ Spider-Man theme song ♫

81
00:05:07,115 --> 00:05:10,622
(Applause)

82
00:05:10,622 --> 00:05:12,548
Thank you.

83
00:05:12,548 --> 00:05:14,921
All right, all right, so --

84
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:16,226
That was pretty cool,

85
00:05:16,226 --> 00:05:19,561
and so I was able
to accomplish my dream

86
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:22,117
of playing snare drum
with the marching band,

87
00:05:22,117 --> 00:05:25,009
as I believe I can do
for all of my dreams.

88
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:30,167
So hopefully, you can accomplish
your dreams as well, with this outlook.

89
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:32,382
The next aspect to my philosophy is

90
00:05:32,382 --> 00:05:36,818
that I surround myself
with people I want to be with,

91
00:05:36,818 --> 00:05:38,634
people of high quality.

92
00:05:38,634 --> 00:05:42,680
I’m extremely lucky
to have an amazing family,

93
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,110
who have always supported me
throughout my entire life.

94
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,489
And I’m also really fortunate to have

95
00:05:48,489 --> 00:05:51,498
a really close group of friends 
at school.

96
00:05:51,498 --> 00:05:55,050
Now we’re kind of goofy,
a lot of us are band geeks,

97
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,412
but we really enjoy 
each other’s company,

98
00:05:57,412 --> 00:06:00,434
and we help each other out 
when we need to.

99
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:04,562
We see each other
for who we are on the inside.

100
00:06:04,562 --> 00:06:06,865
So this is us goofing off a little bit.

101
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:09,372
So we’re juniors in High School now,

102
00:06:09,372 --> 00:06:15,129
and we can now mentor
younger band members,

103
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:16,986
as a single collective unit.

104
00:06:16,986 --> 00:06:19,916
What I love about
being in a group like the band,

105
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,834
is that the music
that we make together,

106
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:28,243
is true, is genuine,
and it supersedes Progeria.

107
00:06:28,243 --> 00:06:29,875
So I don’t have to worry about that

108
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:33,870
when I’m feeling so good
about making music.

109
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,564
But even having made 
a documentary,

110
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:38,975
going on TV a couple of times,

111
00:06:38,975 --> 00:06:41,459
I feel like I’m at my highest point

112
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:45,607
when I’m with the people
that surround me every day.

113
00:06:45,607 --> 00:06:49,005
They provide the real
positive influences in my life,

114
00:06:49,005 --> 00:06:54,699
as I hope I can provide
a positive influence in theirs as well.

115
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:58,247
(Applause)

116
00:06:58,247 --> 00:06:59,436
Thank you.

117
00:06:59,436 --> 00:07:01,395
So the bottom line here,

118
00:07:01,395 --> 00:07:05,294
is that I hope you appreciate
and love your family,

119
00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:08,453
love your friends,
for you guys, love you Bro’s

120
00:07:08,453 --> 00:07:11,860
and acknowledge your mentors,

121
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,557
and your community,

122
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:16,654
because they are a very real
aspect of everyday life,

123
00:07:16,654 --> 00:07:20,980
they can make a truly significant,
positive impact.

124
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,663
The third aspect to the philosophy is,

125
00:07:23,663 --> 00:07:25,898
Keep moving forward.

126
00:07:25,898 --> 00:07:29,686
Here’s a quote by a man
you may know, named Walt Disney,

127
00:07:29,686 --> 00:07:31,495
and it’s one of my favorite quotes.

128
00:07:31,495 --> 00:07:34,230
I always try to have something
to look forward to.

129
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:37,265
Something to strive for
to make my life richer.

130
00:07:37,265 --> 00:07:38,956
It doesn’t have to be big.

131
00:07:38,956 --> 00:07:41,339
It could be anything from

132
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:43,946
looking forward to
the next comic book to come out,

133
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:46,467
or going on a large family vacation,

134
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,736
or hanging out with my friends,

135
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:51,691
to going to the next
High School football game.

136
00:07:51,691 --> 00:07:55,013
However, all of these things
keep me focused,

137
00:07:55,013 --> 00:07:57,851
and know that there’s
a bright future ahead,

138
00:07:57,851 --> 00:08:02,287
and may get me through
some difficult times that I may be having.

139
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:07,795
Now this mentality includes staying
in a forward thinking state of mind.

140
00:08:07,795 --> 00:08:11,389
I try hard not to waste energy
feeling badly for myself,

141
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:14,871
because when I do,
I get stuck in a paradox,

142
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:19,454
where there’s no room for 
any happiness or any other emotion.

143
00:08:19,454 --> 00:08:23,015
Now, it’s not that I ignore
when I’m feeling badly,

144
00:08:23,015 --> 00:08:24,897
I kind of accept it,

145
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:28,273
I let it in, 
so that I can acknowledge it,

146
00:08:28,273 --> 00:08:31,775
and do what I need to do 
to move past it.

147
00:08:31,775 --> 00:08:35,081
When I was younger,
I wanted to be an engineer.

148
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,995
I wanted to be an inventor,

149
00:08:36,995 --> 00:08:40,009
who would catapult the world
into a better future.

150
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:42,183
Maybe this came 
from my love of Legos,

151
00:08:42,183 --> 00:08:44,502
and the freedom of expression 
that I felt

152
00:08:44,502 --> 00:08:47,814
when I was building with them.

153
00:08:47,814 --> 00:08:53,489
And this was also derived
from my family and my mentors,

154
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:57,985
who always make me feel whole,
and good about myself.

155
00:08:57,985 --> 00:09:01,133
Now today my ambitions
have changed a little bit,

156
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:03,609
I’d like to go into the field of Biology,

157
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:07,948
maybe cell biology, or genetics,

158
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:12,417
or biochemistry, or really anything.

159
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:15,698
This is a friend of mine,
who I look up to,

160
00:09:15,698 --> 00:09:19,252
Francis Collins, the director of the NIH,

161
00:09:19,252 --> 00:09:22,670
and this is us at TEDMED last year,
chatting away.

162
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:26,208
I feel that no matter what
I choose to become,

163
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:29,521
I believe that I can change the world.

164
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:34,417
And as I’m striving to change the world,
I will be happy.

165
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:36,562
About four years ago,

166
00:09:36,562 --> 00:09:39,247
HBO began to film a documentary

167
00:09:39,247 --> 00:09:42,282
about my family and me
called “Life According to Sam”.

168
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:46,285
That was a pretty great experience,
but it was also four years ago.

169
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:49,761
And like anyone, my views
on many things have changed,

170
00:09:49,761 --> 00:09:54,165
and hopefully matured,
like my potential career choice.

171
00:09:54,165 --> 00:09:58,798
However, some things have stayed 
the same throughout that time.

172
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:02,679
Like my mentality,
and philosophy towards life.

173
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:04,730
So I would like to show you

174
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,921
a clip of my younger self from the film,

175
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:11,492
that I feel embodies that philosophy.

176
00:10:11,492 --> 00:10:12,659
(Video)

177
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:16,314
I know more about it genetically.

178
00:10:16,314 --> 00:10:19,857
So it’s less of an embodiment now.

179
00:10:19,857 --> 00:10:21,335
It used to be like

180
00:10:21,335 --> 00:10:24,135
this thing that prevents me
from doing all this stuff,

181
00:10:24,135 --> 00:10:26,669
that causes other kids to die,

182
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:29,639
that causes everybody 
to be stressed,

183
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:35,276
and now
it’s a protein that is abnormal,

184
00:10:35,276 --> 00:10:39,072
that weakens the structure of cells.

185
00:10:40,465 --> 00:10:42,076
So,

186
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:45,458
and it takes a burden
off of me because now

187
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:48,210
I don’t have to think about

188
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:51,802
Progeria as an entity.

189
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,507
Okay, pretty good, huh?

190
00:10:57,507 --> 00:11:01,596
(Applause)

191
00:11:01,596 --> 00:11:02,671
Thank you.

192
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:05,990
So, as you can see I’ve been
thinking this way for many years.

193
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,435
But I’d never really had to apply
all of these aspects of my philosophy

194
00:11:10,435 --> 00:11:14,176
to the test at one time, 
until last January.

195
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:19,010
I was pretty sick, I had a chest cold,
and I was in the hospital for a few days,

196
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:23,600
and I was secluded from 
all of the aspects of my life that I felt

197
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,124
made me, me,

198
00:11:25,124 --> 00:11:27,952
that kind of gave me my identity.

199
00:11:27,952 --> 00:11:31,029
But knowing
that I was going to get better,

200
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:34,009
and looking forward to a time
that I would feel good again,

201
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:36,659
helped me to keep moving forward.

202
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:39,211
And sometimes I had to be brave,

203
00:11:39,211 --> 00:11:41,003
and it wasn’t always easy.

204
00:11:41,003 --> 00:11:42,617
Sometimes I faltered,

205
00:11:42,617 --> 00:11:44,363
I had bad days,

206
00:11:44,363 --> 00:11:47,857
but I realized that being brave
isn’t supposed to be easy.

207
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:51,957
And for me, I feel it’s the key way
to keep moving forward.

208
00:11:51,957 --> 00:11:54,181
So, all in all,

209
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:57,725
I don’t waste energy
feeling bad for myself.

210
00:11:57,725 --> 00:12:01,040
I surround myself with people
that I want to be with,

211
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,317
and I keep moving forward.

212
00:12:03,317 --> 00:12:06,689
So with this philosophy,
I hope that all of you,

213
00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:08,766
regardless of your obstacles,

214
00:12:08,766 --> 00:12:11,613
can have a very happy life as well.

215
00:12:11,613 --> 00:12:13,131
Oh, wait, hang on a second,

216
00:12:13,131 --> 00:12:15,619
one more piece of advice –-

217
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:17,219
(Laughter)

218
00:12:17,219 --> 00:12:19,709
Never miss a party if you can help it.

219
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:22,085
My school’s homecoming dance
is tomorrow night,

220
00:12:22,085 --> 00:12:24,169
and I will be there.

221
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:25,641
Thank you very much.

222
00:12:25,641 --> 00:00:00,000
(Applause)
